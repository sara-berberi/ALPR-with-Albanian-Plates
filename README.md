# License Plate Recognition with YOLOv5 and EasyOCR 📋🚗

Welcome to the License Plate Recognition (LPR) project! This repository provides a robust solution for recognizing license plates using state-of-the-art technologies, including YOLOv5 for object detection and EasyOCR for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Whether you're working with a general dataset or need specific support for Albanian plates, this project aims to deliver high accuracy and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv5 to detect license plates in images.
- **Character Recognition**: Employs EasyOCR to extract and digitize alphanumeric characters from the detected plates.
- **Versatility**: Works with both a general dataset and a specialized Albanian dataset.
- **Real-World Applications**: Ideal for toll systems, parking management, and traffic monitoring.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## 📊 Results

The system provides:

- **Detected License Plates**: Visualized in output images with bounding boxes.
- **Extracted Text**: Alphanumeric characters from the license plates saved in a text file.

## 📝 Configuration

Adjust parameters and settings in the `config.py` file to fit your needs:

- **Model Weights**: Specify paths to YOLOv5 weights.
- **OCR Settings**: Configure EasyOCR options as required.
